(a) (20 pts) A brief description of the project. Here, I’m looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.
Multi-level todo list application allows user to create their own todo list which can be sorted by name, date, or completion.

(b) (20 pts) a set of user stories (as a X I can Y so that Z) that describe what the current software in its current state can do.
When complete, this application will allow user to create a todo list of tasks and subtasks that can be edited and sorted using an easy to use GUI.

(c) (20 pts) a brief assessment of whether the software runs or not. If it runs, briefly describe what it does,

The software runs normally, it allows user to add their own Lists and new Tasks in side each Lists. When creat the Task, there are options like choosing the priority level and color. Tasks and Lists are editable and can be sorted by name, priority, date, and completion.


(d) (20 pts) a set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better, etc.

Implement weekly and monthly view for TodoList, so that user can be more easier to see tasks that are coming up and tasks they were completed before.

Improve the GUI. Right now the GUI feels like a lot of out of date, we want to improve the GUI to a flat kind of style to make it adapts modern aesthetics.

Implement Google calendar support so that users can export and import their list to Google calendar.


(e) (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md. What information could be added to make it easier for the next generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software?
- More information about the connection of every class. Add more description of each class's functionality.
- The image need a new hyperlink, the current one is dead.


(f) (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file. Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).
-All the targets in the build.xml file have detailed descriptions.

(g) (20 pts) An assessment of the current “issues”. Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?

There are enough issues that we could earn 1000 poinnts by working on this project. And all issues are clearly descripted.


(h) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.

We decided to 1. Make it a better GUI.
	      2. Implement weekly view for TodoList.
	      3. Implement monthly calender view for TodoList.
	      4. Add Google Calendar sync function.
	      5. Add Undo function.


(i) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just “one screenful of text” to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?


(j) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?
