1. Special features:
-This program simply creates a list of lists and tasks with sorting properties. It would be great if it had more interesting features. Examples include a timer, time left until the next task, reminders, etc. This issue has some flexibility, and points will be awarded depending on the the quantity and quality of added features. (200 points)
2. Add a description feature for tasks:
-Include a description feature for a task, so that clicking on a task or task button sends the user to a description of that particular task. (200 points)
3. Add a feature that lets you edit or add tasks directly to the monthly view windows:
-Right now the monthly view is only implemented for displaying tasks. Implement a new function that allows the user to edit or add tasks directly to the monthly view window.
4. Improving user experience by adding a time/date picker:
-A date/time picker would make the user become easier to select their desired time/date instead of input time manually.
